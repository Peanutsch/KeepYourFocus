Thank you for testing the heck out of my very first try-out in C# coding!

* Simon Says-like game with some level based challenges
* Each level has 6 sequences. After 6 succesful sequences:
* Level++; Add 1 challenge; Clear correctOrder and playerOrder and start with new sequence = 1
* From Level >= 7: no Clear correctOrder; sequences++ untill game over
* More challenges, tiles and sounds in progress
* Next update: file encryption!
* === Levels ===
* Level 1 [EasyPeasy]: standard
* level 2 [OkiDoki] and onward: some misleading text in pictureboxes, plus
Shuffle Pictureboxes before start player's turn with 55% chance; level 3 75% chance; >= level 5 85% chance
* level 3 [Please No]: Shuffle Pictureboxes per player click with 55% chance; level 4 75% chance; >= level 6 85% chance
* Level 4 [No Way!]: When level up, replace all tile squares on board with 55%; level 5 75%; >= level 7 85%
* level 5 [HELL NO]: In each sequence, replace one tile in running order with 55% chance; level 6 75% chance; level 8 85%
* level 6 [NONONONO]: Replace 1 tile with other tile on board and in running order in the running order with 55% chance;\r\n   level 7 75% chance; >= level 9 85%
* level 666 [HELLMODE]: No Clear correctOrder; sequences++ untill game over
